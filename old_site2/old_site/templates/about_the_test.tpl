    <h2>Telephone Telepathy</h2>
    <p class="tt_comment">Many people have noticed that they sometimes think of someone who then rings them soon afterwards, and say something like, “I was just thinking of you!” Is this just a coincidence, or could it involve telepathy or precognition?

To take part in this experiment you need four contacts, who should be family members or other people you know well. You all need to have cell phones, and your senders will need to have some credit. The test takes very little of anyone's time and you can conduct it from any computer with an internet connection. All calls in this test need to be made on cell phones, not on landlines. All particpants (including yourself) need to register to use the system. This can be done on the main login page of this site. After registration, you will need to add each caller to your friends list. This can be done via the <a href="http://telepathyexperiment.com/invite">Invite Friends</a> menu item.

You all need to be in the U.S. or to have U.S.-based cell phones. The <a href="http://telepathyexperiment.com/settings">Settings</a> menu item allows each user to specify their cell phone carrier. This is an important step as this experiment supports SMS messaging for only certain carriers. If your carrier is not listed, please notify the webmaster via the <a href="http://telepathyexperiment.com/contact">Contact Us</a> link at the bottom of the page.</p>
    <h2>How the test works</h2>
    <p class="tt_comment">After you have registered, you can begin an experiment at any time by selecting the Conduct Experiment menu item. Your list of friends will appear in the My Friends list on the left of the page. After you've selected four participants for the experiment the system will prompt you to begin the test. A test consists of eight trials. At the start of a trial the system will randomly select a caller from the group of four you've selected. An SMS message will then be sent to the caller asking them to contact you. You must then guess who the caller is. You can answer the call at any time, but you will not be actually connected to the caller until you have entered a guess. At the end of eight trials the system will report your results. The expected hit rate according to chance is 25%.

A window at the bottom of the page will provide you with instructions and feedback throughout the test.

The video below presents some background information as well as a demonstration of a different implementation of the test, however the principles remain the same.</p>
